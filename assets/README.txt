The app checks the audio folder and builds a tab for each folder inside. Then it populates the tab with all mp3 files that are inside the corresponding folder. Then the app checks the images folder and links the image in each subfolder of images with the folders listed in audio and matches them up. 

Example, if I have a folder in audio called "dog", which has an mp3 file "bark.mp3", and in the images folder I have a folder also called "dog" and in it is a picture of a dog, then the app will link everything up to have its own tab and the image will be the skin of each button.
